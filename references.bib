@BOOK{Beck2004,
  title = {{Extreme Programming Explained : Embrace Change (2nd Edition)}},
  publisher = {{Addison-Wesley Professional}},
  year = {2004},
  author = {Kent Beck and Cynthia Andres},
  month = {November},
  abstract = {{Kent Beck's <I>eXtreme Programming eXplained</I> provides an intriguing
	high-level overview of the author's Extreme Programming (XP) software
	development methodology. Written for IS managers, project leaders,
	or programmers, this guide provides a glimpse at the principles behind
	XP and its potential advantages for small- to mid-size software development
	teams.<p> The book intends to describe what XP is, its guiding principles,
	and how it works. Simply written, the book avoids case studies and
	concrete details in demonstrating the efficacy of XP. Instead, it
	demonstrates how XP relies on simplicity, unit testing, programming
	in pairs, communal ownership of code, and customer input on software
	to motivate code improvement during the development process. As the
	author notes, these principles are not new, but when they're combined
	their synergy fosters a new and arguably better way to build and
	maintain software. Throughout the book, the author presents and explains
	these principles, such as "rapid feedback" and "play to win," which
	form the basis of XP.<p> Generally speaking, XP changes the way programmers
	work. The book is good at delineating new roles for programmers and
	managers who Beck calls "coaches." The most striking characteristic
	of XP is that programmers work in pairs, and that testing is an intrinsic
	part of the coding process. In a later section, the author even shows
	where XP works and where it doesn't and offers suggestions for migrating
	teams and organizations over to the XP process. <p> In the afterword,
	the author recounts the experiences that led him to develop and refine
	XP, an insightful section that should inspire any organization to
	adopt XP. This book serves as a useful introduction to the philosophy
	and practice of XP for the manager or programmer who wants a potentially
	better way to build software. <I>--Richard Dragan</I><p> <B>Topics
	covered</B>: Extreme Programming (XP) software methodology, principles,
	XP team roles, facilities design, testing, refactoring, the XP software
	lifecycle, and adopting XP.} {Software development projects can be
	fun, productive, and even daring. Yet they can consistently deliver
	value to a business and remain under control. <P>Extreme Programming
	(XP) was conceived and developed to address the specific needs of
	software development conducted by small teams in the face of vague
	and changing requirements. This new lightweight methodology challenges
	many conventional tenets, including the long-held assumption that
	the cost of changing a piece of software necessarily rises dramatically
	over the course of time. XP recognizes that projects have to work
	to achieve this reduction in cost and exploit the savings once they
	have been earned. <P>Fundamentals of XP include: <P>* Distinguishing
	between the decisions to be made by business interests and those
	to be made by project stakeholders. * Writing unit tests before programming
	and keeping all of the tests running at all times. * Integrating
	and testing the whole system-several times a day. * Producing all
	software in pairs, two programmers at one screen. * Starting projects
	with a simple design that constantly evolves to add needed flexibility
	and remove unneeded complexity. * Putting a minimal system into production
	quickly and growing it in whatever directions prove most valuable.
	<P>Why is XP so controversial? Some sacred cows don't make the cut
	in XP: <P>* Don't force team members to specialize and become analysts,
	architects, programmers, testers, and integrators-every XP programmer
	participates in all of these critical activities every day. * Don't
	conduct complete up-front analysis and design-an XP project starts
	with a quick analysis of the entire system, and XP programmers continue
	to make analysis and design decisions throughout development. * Develop
	infrastructure and frameworks as you develop your application, not
	up-front-delivering business value is the heartbeat that drives XP
	projects. * Don't write and maintain implementation documentation-communication
	in XP projects occurs face-to-face, or through efficient tests and
	carefully written code. <P>You may love XP or you may hate it, but
	Extreme Programming Explained will force you to take a fresh look
	at how you develop software.}},

  year = {1994},

  pages = {476-493},
  number = {6},
  month = {June},
  abstract = {Given the central role that software development plays in the delivery
	and application of information technology, managers are increasingly
	focusing on process improvement in the software development area.
	This demand has spurred the provision of a number of new and/or improved
	approaches to software development, with perhaps the most prominent
	being object-orientation (OO). In addition, the focus on process
	improvement has increased the demand for software measures, or metrics
	with which to manage the process. The need for such metrics is particularly
	acute when an organization is adopting a new technology for which
	established practices have yet to be developed. This research addresses
	these needs through the development and implementation of a new suite
	of metrics for OO design. Metrics developed in previous research,
	while contributing to the field's understanding of software development
	processes, have generally been subject to serious criticisms, including
	the lack of a theoretical base. Following Wand and Weber (1989),
	the theoretical base chosen for the metrics was the ontology of Bunge
	(1977). Six design metrics are developed, and then analytically evaluated
	against Weyuker's (1988) proposed set of measurement principles.
	An automated data collection tool was then developed and implemented
	to collect an empirical sample of these metrics at two field sites
	in order to demonstrate their feasibility and suggest ways in which
	managers may use these metrics for process improvement},

  abstract = {The histories of software systems hold useful information when reasoning
	about the systems at hand or when reasoning about general laws of
	software evolution. Over the past 30 years, research has been increasingly
	spent on understanding software evolution. However, the approaches
	developed so far do not rely on an explicit meta-model and, thus,
	they make it difficult to reuse or compare their results. We argue
	that there is a need for an explicit meta-model for software evolution
	analysis. We present a survey of the evolution analyses and deduce
	a set of requirements that an evolution meta-model should have. We
	define Hismo, a meta-model in which history is modeled as an explicit
	entity. Hismo adds a time layer on top of structural information,
	and provides a common infrastructure for expressing and combining
	evolution analyses and structural analyses. We validate the usefulness
	of our meta-model by presenting how different analyses are expressed
	on it.},
